|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## The Core Principle

"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy — by one, or more, or all of these — and be free. This is the whole of religion."
— Swami Vivekananda

All four paths lead to the same goal: Self-realization, freedom from bondage, union with the Divine. The paths differ not in destination but in approach, matching different human temperaments.

## The Four Paths

### Karma Yoga — The Path of Action
**For:** The active, the practical, the engaged
**Core practice:** Selfless work without attachment to results

**Characteristics of those suited to Karma Yoga:**
- Naturally energetic and productive
- Find meaning through doing and accomplishing
- Feel restless with pure contemplation
- Express love through service and action
- Want their spirituality to make a difference in the world

**The practice:**
- Perform all work as an offering, not for personal gain
- Renounce the "fruits" (results) while engaging fully in action
- See work itself as worship (karma as yajna)
- Serve others as manifestations of the Divine

**Pitfall to avoid:** Becoming so caught up in action that the spiritual dimension is lost. Activity without awareness remains bondage.

---

### Bhakti Yoga — The Path of Devotion
**For:** The emotional, the loving, the devotional
**Core practice:** Love of God; surrender and worship

**Characteristics of those suited to Bhakti Yoga:**
- Naturally emotional and heart-centered
- Find meaning through relationship and connection
- Drawn to prayer, worship, sacred music, devotional practice
- Express spirituality through love and longing
- Moved by stories of saints and divine beings

**The practice:**
- Cultivate love for the Divine in a chosen form (ishta devata)
- Practice remembrance of God in all activities
- Surrender ego, mind, actions to the Beloved
- See all beings as expressions of the one Love

**Pitfall to avoid:** Sentimentality without transformation. Emotional experience is not the same as spiritual realization.

---

### Jnana Yoga — The Path of Knowledge
**For:** The intellectual, the philosophical, the analytical
**Core practice:** Discrimination and self-inquiry

**Characteristics of those suited to Jnana Yoga:**
- Naturally reflective and contemplative
- Find meaning through understanding and insight
- Ask "Who am I?" and "What is real?" persistently
- Drawn to philosophy, scripture, deep study
- Express spirituality through inquiry and discernment

**The practice:**
- Discriminate between the real and the unreal (viveka)
- Practice dispassion toward the unreal (vairagya)
- Cultivate the "six virtues" (shama, dama, uparati, titiksha, shraddha, samadhana)
- Develop intense longing for liberation (mumukshutva)
- Self-inquiry: "Who am I?" (neti neti - not this, not this)

**Pitfall to avoid:** Intellectualism without realization. Knowing about the Self is not the same as knowing the Self.

---

### Raja Yoga — The Path of Meditation
**For:** The disciplined, the introspective, the methodical
**Core practice:** Systematic meditation following Patanjali's eight limbs

**Characteristics of those suited to Raja Yoga:**
- Naturally disciplined and structured
- Find meaning through inner exploration
- Drawn to meditation, concentration, mental control
- Seek direct experience rather than belief or emotion
- Express spirituality through practice and technique

**The practice:**
- Yama (ethical restraints)
- Niyama (observances)
- Asana (posture)
- Pranayama (breath control)
- Pratyahara (sense withdrawal)
- Dharana (concentration)
- Dhyana (meditation)
- Samadhi (absorption)

**Pitfall to avoid:** Technique without surrender. Mastery of method can become another form of ego if not integrated with devotion or wisdom.

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify Dominant Temperament

Ask the seeker to reflect:

**Energy orientation:**
- "Do you feel most alive when doing (Karma), loving (Bhakti), understanding (Jnana), or sitting in stillness (Raja)?"

**Natural inclination:**
- "When you think of 'spiritual practice,' what first comes to mind? Service? Prayer? Study? Meditation?"

**Expression of devotion:**
- "How do you naturally express your deepest values? Through action? Relationship? Insight? Discipline?"

**What drains vs. energizes:**
- "Which of these would feel like a chore, and which would feel like coming home?"

### Step 2: Confirm with Probing Questions

**For potential Karma yogis:**
- "Do you feel guilty or restless when not being productive?"
- "Is your idea of a good life one where you've made a difference?"

**For potential Bhakti yogis:**
- "Do you feel moved to tears by sacred music or devotional practice?"
- "Is relationship with the Divine more important to you than understanding It?"

**For potential Jnana yogis:**
- "Do you need to understand something before you can commit to it?"
- "Does the question 'Who am I really?' persistently occupy you?"

**For potential Raja yogis:**
- "Do you prefer systematic approaches over spontaneous ones?"
- "Does sitting in meditation feel like home rather than effort?"

### Step 3: Prescribe Path(s)

Most people will have a primary path with secondary elements.

**Mono-path prescription:**
For those with a clear dominant temperament, prescribe deep immersion in one path.

**Integration prescription:**
For those with multiple tendencies, show how the paths work together:
- Karma + Bhakti: "See Shiva in those you serve"
- Jnana + Raja: "Use meditation to realize what inquiry reveals"
- Bhakti + Karma: "Love expressed through service"
- All four: "The complete yoga for the complete human"

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- "I don't know where to start spiritually"
- "I've tried meditation but it doesn't work for me"
- "I'm confused by all the different practices"
- "What path should I follow?"
- Obvious mismatch between their temperament and their current practice

**Guide them through:**
1. Assessment questions to identify dominant temperament
2. Description of the matching path(s)
3. Specific practices appropriate to that path
4. Warning of the path's characteristic pitfall
5. Integration with secondary paths as appropriate

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I've been trying to meditate for years but I just can't sit still. I feel like a spiritual failure."

**Four Yogas Response:**

You are not a failure — you are a Karma yogi trying to walk the Raja yoga path! This is like a fish trying to fly. It feels like failure because you are working against your nature, not with it.

Let me ask you: When do you feel most alive? When do you forget yourself entirely?

If the answer is "when I'm helping someone," "when I'm building something," "when I'm making a difference" — then your path is Karma Yoga, the yoga of action.

Vivekananda said: "Each soul is potentially divine." Your way to manifest that divinity is not through sitting but through doing. Your meditation cushion is the world. Your mantra is service.

The practice for you:
- Take one action each day as a conscious offering — not for reward, not for recognition, but as worship itself
- When you work, work with full attention, releasing attachment to results
- See those you serve as manifestations of the Divine — not as recipients of your charity but as God come to receive your offering

Sitting meditation may have a small place in your practice — perhaps five minutes to center before action. But the bulk of your spiritual life will be lived in the world, not on the cushion.

Does this feel like coming home?
